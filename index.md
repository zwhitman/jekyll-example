##	Overview
###	Background
Enterprise-wide data visualization standards for the U.S. Census Bureau are a longstanding requirement for all dissemination activities. To date, data visualization production and publishing guidelines have existed in varying degrees of maturity across the directorates, which has led to disparate designs, implementations, and brand identities. Specific guidance for interactive and static web and print-based data visualizations are required to not only improve data communication efforts and public brand awareness, but also to ensure compliance with government-wide accessibility standards.

### Purpose
This project will define specific standards for the development of consistent, accessible, and methodologically correct data visualizations along with supporting materials to assist staff in creating these visualizations, as well as the standards and processes to follow when reviewing their acceptability. All final outputs from this effort will be made open source and publically accessible.

##	Project scope, methodology, and deliverables
### Scope
The Open Data Visualization Project shall define acceptable data visualization types, formats, and practices for use by Census Bureau dissemination efforts, as well as outline any specific practices that should explicitly not be used when developing a data visualization. The standards will be for internal and external purposes and applicable to both web and print media. The project will also define a generalized process for the review and approval of data visualizations as well as provide staff with data visualization resources to assist in the development of compliant visualizations. The project will be complete by January 2018.

Public v. Internal
1.	Public-facing w/ seal
2.	Sponsored information products (joint publish)
3.	Professional papers (journals + working papers)
4.	Professional/public Conferences
5.	Agency to agency (working groups/conferences)
6.	Presented internally to Census staff

### Methodology
A development team will identify and review Census Bureau standards and guidelines related to data visualization. The team will also identify and review best practices for data visualization.  Based on these reviews, the team will prepare an initial draft for all of the deliverables listed below. Reviewers from each directorate will periodically verify that proposed revisions can be incorporated into the work processes for their directorates and suggest changes as desired. Once the development team and reviewers agree on a final draft, the team will submit the proposed revisions for formal review and approval by the Methodology and Standards Council and the Census Bureauâ€™s Operating Committee.

### Deliverables
The team will develop the following:

1.	Data visualization standards:
 - A defined list of acceptable data visualization types;
 - Defined guidelines in choosing data visualization types;
 - Pixel-specific data visualization design standards (e.g. font size, typeface, kerning); and
 - Data visualization features that are unacceptable.
2. Data visualization review process:
  - A generalized review process for data visualization products that use information products from one or more directorates.
3. Data visualization guidelines
  - A cohesive set of guidelines and resources to include pre-reviewed templates that could be implemented with minimal review as a means to help staff create data visualizations that follow the data visualization standards. These resources will include product-specific aids, such as productivity software and language-specific development environments (e.g. javascript, python, R, Excel, and Tableau), to automate the implementation of desired practices.

## Milestones

## Review
- Review process
  + automated viz review code to assess deviations from the base library standard
