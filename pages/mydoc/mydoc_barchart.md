## Overview
Column and bar charts show the difference among data categories and encourage the reader to make comparisons among categories. The stair stepping created by data plotted in this chart format allows the reader to easily see small and large differences in the categories. Most Census publications are portrait orientation, thus larger data sets are displayed in column charts.

## Description
A bar chart is a chart with rectangular bars with lengths proportional to the values that they represent.  One axis of the chart shows the specific categories being compared, and the other axis represents a discrete value.

Bar charts provide a visual presentation of categorical data. Categorical data is a grouping of data into discrete groups, such as months of the year, age group, shoe sizes, and animals. These categories are usually qualitative. Bars on the chart may be arranged in any order.
