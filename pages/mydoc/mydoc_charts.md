## Overview
Charts are the visual expression of numbers arranged in symbolic shapes. These shapes are organized using the basic structure of the Cartesian coordinates. A precise title, thorough labeling, and source of the data support the chart design. Use charts to:
- Highlight important patterns in the data.
- Display proportional relationships that would not be clear in text or tables.
- Save time for the reader, a good chart is an efficient means of communication.

### Getting Started

- Have a clear idea of what is being communicated.
- Select the information needed to illustrate your point, eliminate irrelevant information.
